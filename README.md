# Content-Based-Image-Search

Leveraged the combined power of Instruct Blip, Sentence Transformers, and Faiss.
Integrated Sentence Transformers, which transformed textual queries into highly informative and context-aware embeddings.
Used Faiss, a high-performance similarity search library. I meticulously configured Faiss to efficiently search through the vast database of image embeddings generated by Instruct Blip and Sentence Transformers. This allowed our system to rapidly identify and retrieve images that closely matched the textual queries. The result of this project is a groundbreaking system that empowers users to perform image searches using only text. Users can initiate searches for a wide range of images merely by describing what they are looking for.
